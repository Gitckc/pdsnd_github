### The Bikeshare Project

### Description
This project, written in Python will explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities Chicago, New York, and Washington.  Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in numbers and popularity in cities across the world.  Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis - allowing people to rent (get the bikes) at one location and returning it at another (or the same location if they choose).

Importing data and computing descriptive statistics, the project will answer questions about user behaviors and usage patterns.  For example, answering questions as to which travel times and which stations are the most popular, the duration of the rentals, and demographic of its renters.

Through an interactive experience, the program will solicit inputs from users to customize and present the data they are interested in.  For example, asking which city's data they would like to look at, during which months, or the days of the week, and whether they would like to see the raw data on which the statistics were derived.
